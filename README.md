# Space Travel Calculator 
Have you ever asked the question of how long would it take for you to travel to any of the potential habitable planets in our universe?

How about asking this question from the perspective of the actual flight time within the ship itself? 

This calculator was designed to answers these kinds of questions.

## What Does Space Travel Calculator Do?
Space Travel Calaculator is a collection of libraries, utilities and scripts that allows a user to performi basic calculations around space travel taking into consideration concepts such as special relativity.

## This Calculator focuses on the SO WHAT.
The entire purpose of this calculator is to understand space travel from the average human's intellect, not from the perspective of a super math genius. With this in mind, the calculator is for answering "so what?" type questions rather than focusing on the technicals.

### It turns out the "so what" of some concepts like special relativity, are actually VERY interesting.
This is why I made this calculator.
